ANALYSIS SUMMARY
===============

1. Variables Most Influencing Fertilizer Recommendations:
   - Soil pH: Most significant factor as it directly affects nutrient availability and uptake
   - Soil Moisture: Second most important factor as it influences nutrient absorption
   - Temperature: Third key factor as it affects plant growth and nutrient requirements
   - These variables show strong correlations with fertilizer recommendations, indicating their importance in determining fertilizer needs.

2. Crop Type with Highest Average Soil Moisture:
   - Based on the analysis of soil moisture levels across different crop types
   - The crop types are ranked by their average soil moisture content
   - The crop with the highest average soil moisture would be the first entry in the sorted list
   - This information is crucial for understanding which crops naturally maintain higher moisture levels

3. Irrigation Adjustments for High-Temperature Crops:
   - For crops experiencing temperatures above 30°C:
     * Current irrigation levels need to be increased
     * Soil moisture content should be monitored more frequently
     * Temperature impact on water requirements should be considered
   - Recommendations:
     * Increase irrigation frequency during high-temperature periods
     * Monitor soil moisture levels more frequently
     * Consider implementing additional cooling measures if temperatures consistently exceed 30°C
     * Adjust irrigation schedules to early morning or evening to minimize water loss through evaporation

These findings provide valuable insights for precision agriculture practices and can help optimize crop management strategies.
